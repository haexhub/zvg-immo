-- Idempotent bootstrap, run on every boot via runMigrations() (see
-- server/utils/db.ts). Phase 1 has nothing app-specific to create yet — this
-- just ensures pgcrypto is available for gen_random_uuid(), which every
-- later phase's uuid primary keys (saved_searches, watchlist_items, ...)
-- depend on. Later phases append their own CREATE TABLE blocks below.

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
